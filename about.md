# About page

### Hi, welcome to my space.

### I love reading :book:, dancing  and playing with data. Therefore here will be the place where I show my reviews on books I read (or ideas about the books I would like to read:) ) and skills I have learned while dealing with data.


### I am pursuing a career in Data Science and really enjoy solving each single problem I met in the field. Hopefully, I can share these in the future. 


### If you have any question, drop by and have a cup of coffe :coffee: (vitually :computer:)
